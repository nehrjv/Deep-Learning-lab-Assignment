1. Write a program to implement the AlexNet model (Note : You can use any publically
available dataset for testing). While implementing you have to show following things:
 Display sample input and output images (at least 10 images).
 Display the total images in the database, size of the image, no of classes in the
database.
 Display the first convolution function kernel filter coefficient values
 Display the training accuracy / training error
 Display the testing accuracy
2. Write a program to implement the new CNN model. The model should contains following
things : (Note : use any grayscale dataset with the 10 classes)
1. Convolution #1. Input = 32x32x1. Output = 28x28x6 conv2d 
2. SubSampling #1. Input = 28x28x6. Output = 14x14x6. SubSampling is simply Average Pooling so we use avgpool 
3. Convolution #2. Input = 14x14x6. Output = 10x10x16 conv2d
4. SubSampling #2. Input = 10x10x16. Output = 5x5x16 avg_pool 
5. Fully Connected #1. Input = 5x5x16. Output = 120 
6. Fully Connected #2. Input = 120. Output = 84 
7. Output 10
